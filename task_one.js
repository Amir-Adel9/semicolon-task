// Create a function that takes the array of students and prints each student and their grade to the console.

// The grade is calculated as follows:
// If the score is less than 50, the grade is 'F'.
// If the score is between 50 and 60, the grade is 'D'.
// If the score is between 60 and 70, the grade is 'C'.
// If the score is between 70 and 80, the grade is 'B'.
// If the score is higher than 80, the grade is 'A'.

// The output for each student should look like this: "Name: -student name-, Grade: -student grade-"

// Bonus: Sort the students by their grade in descending order into a new array and print the new array to the console. (Hint: Use the sort method)
